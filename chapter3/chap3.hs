  Really nothing interesting happened in this chapter. Type System explained.
  
  Polymorphic Types and Overloaded Functions.
  
  A Polymorphic Function works on many types but has the same definition on all of them.
  A Overloaded function may work on several types but also has different definition.

  Polymorphism: one definition, many types
  Overloading:  different definition for different types.

  keyword: parametric polymorphism, see also https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/fpv/WS20/assets/slides.pdf slide 77
